lifecycle hooks ->
constructor
ngOnChanges -> called everytime when there is a change in any @input bound property.
ngOninit() -> this lifecycle hook is called when component is loaded and all input bound properties are set.
	it is called only once when component is loaded into DOM. Angular implemets this interface whether you implement or not.
if we want to add something once the component is loaded, this is the place like subscribing to data from the api
initalize some third party lib.
ngDocheck() -> whenever there is an change detection. it will keep on checking the values on every change detection, if any values not getting checked we can put that on ngDoCheck.
ngAfterContentInit -> in Angular there is a way we can project content into view. this lifecycle method will be called once
content projection is completed.
ngAfterContentChecked -> called once after ngAfterContentInit and everytime after ngDoCheck.
ngAfterViewInit
ngAfterViewChecked -> called once after ngAfterContentViewinit and everytime after ngDocheck.
