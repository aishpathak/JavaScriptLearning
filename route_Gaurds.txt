-->Gaurds: Route gaurds are interfaces which tell the router whether or not it should allow navigate to a requested route.

--> Guard Function: can return either a boolean or Observable<boolean> or Promise<boolean> which resolve to a boolean at some point in the future.

Gaurds: basically implemented like a service.All services in angular should be registered in providers array.

    1. CanActivate: we use before visiting a route to check if the user is authenticated or not. to check if the user should access the route or not ?
                    
    2. CanActivateChild: Similar to CanActivate it  is to check if as user can visit a routes children.

    3. CanDeactivate: can use before leaving the route. suppose we have some unsaved changes we can ask for confirmation from user before leaving the route.

    4. Resolve: We want to have some data before visiting the targated component.In that case until the data not get resolve the route will wait.
                performs route data retrieval before route activation.

    5. CanLoad:Checks to see if a user can route to a module that lazy loaded.


    CanActivate: interface that a class can implement to be guard deciding if a route can be activated .
                 if all guards returns flase, navigation will be cancelled.
