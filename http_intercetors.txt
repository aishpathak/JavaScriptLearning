interceptors are a unique type of angular Service to which we can implement to intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HttpClient

various operations using interceptors:
1. Modify HTTP Headers
2. Modifying the request body.
3. Set authentication/authorization token
4. Mock the backend api
5. modify the response
6. Error handling

in interceptor service we have HttpInterceptor interface which have intercept method which we need to implement.
and in intercept method we can pass two parameter(request: HttpRequest ,next: HttpHandler), we return next.handle after our logic.
we can modify request object but as it is imutable class we have to clone the object then we can modify
const req= request.clone({
    setHeaders:{
        API_KEy,
    }
})
