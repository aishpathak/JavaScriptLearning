ngRx is a frameworkforreactiveangular application
Now implementing ngrx in the application
Install store-> npm install @ngrx/store

1. now create state-> named counter.state.this
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0;
    }

2. Create Action
    counter.actions.ts

    export const increment = createAction('increment');
    export const decrement = createAction('decrement');
    export const reset = createAction('reset')

3. create reducer-> reducer will decide upon calling action what is the thing i need to do.

    const _counterReducer = createReducer(
        initialState,
        on(increment,(state)) =>{
            return {
                ...state,
                counter: state.counter + 1, 
            }
        }
    );

     export function counterReducer(state,action){
        return _counterReducer(state,sction)
    }
